# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

Currently in life I wonder very often where motivation lies and what is actually worthwhile and interesting,  So I decided to take a class on coding.   I built this project as prework study guide to learn git, html, Java and CSS. It gives me a place to work on the knowledge I am trying to learn.  I learned a lot about git hub and how it works, pulling, pushing, origin, main, and different terms that make up the git hub experience, I learned about CLI, MVP, and what a markdown is!
